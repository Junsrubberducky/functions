<p>"you could make your website about anything, dogs, cats, your love of math..."  - Madame Bernatchez, 2025</p>

    <li>cats</li>
    <li>math</li>
</ul>
<h2>First, dogs...</h2>
<ol>
   <li>cuties</li>
<p>you know how when you meet a dog, and you think "cute"? that's good. that's the only natural reaction. you are a rock if you disagree.</p>
   <li>lovable</li>
<p>dogs are pure, trusting and ever so affectionate, what's not to love? i'm sure you agree.</p>
   <li>smart</li>
<p>do you have any idea how smart dogs are? you probably do, cause it's well known, they're really intelligent cuties who feel, and think, and should be cherished like no being ever before.</p>
